# Level 9: Build Systems & Developer Experience

**Goal**: Master modern build tools, bundlers, and developer experience optimization to create efficient, maintainable, and scalable development workflows.

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Configure and optimize modern build systems (Webpack, Vite, Rollup)
- Implement advanced bundling strategies and code splitting
- Set up comprehensive development tooling and automation
- Optimize build performance and developer productivity
- Create maintainable build configurations and CI/CD pipelines

## Prerequisites
- Level 8: Design System Development

- Bundle analysis and optimization techniques
- Tree shaking and dead code elimination
- Asset optimization and compression
- Performance monitoring and metrics

### 4. Development Tooling & Automation
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) setup
- Development servers and proxying
- Linting and formatting automation
- Testing integration and automation
- Debugging tools and source maps

### 5. CI/CD & Deployment Pipelines
- GitHub Actions and GitLab CI setup
