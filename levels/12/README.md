# Level 12: Advanced React Patterns

**Goal**: Master advanced React patterns and architectural concepts to build sophisticated, maintainable, and scalable React applications.

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Master higher-order components (HOCs) for logic reuse and composition
- Implement render props pattern for flexible component composition
- Build compound components for complex UI structures
- Apply advanced context patterns and optimization techniques
- Create sophisticated custom hooks and composition patterns
- Design intuitive and flexible component APIs

## Prerequisites
- Level 11: Advanced Frontend Architecture
- Strong understanding of React hooks and component patterns

- Data fetching with render props
- State sharing and composition
- Render props vs HOCs comparison
- Advanced render props patterns

### 3. Compound Components
- Building complex UI components
- Context integration in compound components
- Flexible and intuitive APIs
- Composition patterns and accessibility
- Real-world compound component examples

### 4. Advanced Hook Patterns
- Custom hook libraries and collections
- Hook composition and testing strategies
- Performance hooks (useMemo, useCallback, useRef)
- Hook optimization and best practices
- Complex state management with hooks

### 5. Component Architecture
- Design principles for maintainable components
- Prop drilling solutions and alternatives
- Error boundaries and error handling
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Performance optimization techniques
