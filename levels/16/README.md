# Level 16: React Router & Navigation

**Goal**: Master React Router and navigation patterns for single-page applications, building complex routing systems with proper URL management and seamless user experiences.

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Master React Router setup, configuration, and advanced routing patterns
- Handle navigation state with URL management, history, and browser integration
- Implement route protection with authentication guards and access control
- Build nested routes with complex routing hierarchies and layout patterns
- Optimize navigation with code splitting, lazy loading, and performance optimization
- Create dynamic routes with parameterized routes and dynamic navigation

## Prerequisites
- Level 15: React Performance Optimization
- Strong understanding of React components and lifecycle
- Experience with JavaScript ES6+ including modules and async/await
- Basic knowledge of web concepts including URLs, routing, and browser history API

## Modules

### 1. React Router Fundamentals
- Router setup with BrowserRouter, HashRouter, and MemoryRouter
- Basic routing with Route, Switch, and Link components
- Navigation with programmatic navigation and history manipulation
- Route parameters with dynamic segments and URL parameters
- Query parameters with search params and URL state management

### 2. Advanced Routing Patterns
- Nested routes with route hierarchies and layout components
- Route guards with authentication and authorization protection
- Route transitions with animated transitions and loading states
- Route configuration with centralized route configuration
- Route validation with parameter validation and error handling

### 3. Navigation State Management
- URL state management for application state in URLs
- History API integration and browser history manipulation
- Location state for passing data through navigation
- Route context for sharing route data across components
- Navigation events for listening to route changes and updates

### 4. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- Route-based splitting with lazy loading route components
- Dynamic imports with code splitting using React.lazy
- Suspense integration with loading states and error boundaries
- Preloading for routes and components
- Bundle optimization for route-based bundles

### 5. Advanced Navigation Features
- Breadcrumbs with dynamic breadcrumb navigation
- Tab navigation with tab-based routing and state persistence
- Modal routes with modal-based navigation patterns
- Deep linking with handling deep links and external navigation
- SEO optimization with server-side rendering and meta tags

## Mini-Project: Advanced E-commerce Application
Build a comprehensive e-commerce application with advanced routing patterns and navigation features.

**Project Features**:
- Complete routing system with nested routes and layouts
- Product listing and detail pages with dynamic routing
- Shopping cart with persistent state and URL integration
- User authentication with protected routes and route guards
- Checkout process with multi-step navigation and state management
- Admin dashboard with role-based route protection and breadcrumb navigation
