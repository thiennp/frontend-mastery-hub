# Level 3: Functions & Scope

**Goal**: Master JavaScript functions, scope, closures, and functional programming patterns to write clean, maintainable code.

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Understand function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions
- Master scope chain, lexical scoping, and closure concepts
- Implement higher-order functions and function composition
- Apply currying, partial application, and functional programming patterns
- Build reusable utility functions and functional programming libraries

## Prerequisites
- Level 2: Control Flow & Data Structures
- Basic understanding of JavaScript syntax
- Familiarity with variables and data types

## Modules

### 1. Function Fundamentals & Types
- Function declarations vs expressions
- Arrow functions and their behavior
- Function parameters and arguments
- Return statements and implicit returns
- Function hoisting and temporal dead zone

### 2. Scope Chain & Lexical Scoping
- Global, function, and block scope
- Scope chain resolution
- Lexical scoping vs dynamic scoping
- Variable shadowing and best practices
- `let`, `const`, and `var` scope differences

### 3. Closures & Memory Management
- Understanding closures
- Closure creation and execution
- Memory leaks and garbage collection
- Practical closure patterns
- Module pattern and encapsulation

### 4. Higher-Order Functions
- Functions as first-class citizens
- Callback functions and patterns
- Array methods (map, filter, reduce, forEach)
- Custom higher-order functions
- Function factories and generators

### 5. Function Composition & Currying
- Function composition principles
- Currying and partial application
- Pipe and compose utilities
- Point-free programming style
- Functional programming patterns

## Mini-Project: Functional Utilities Library
Build a comprehensive utility library demonstrating advanced function patterns, closures, and functional programming concepts.

**Project Features**:
- Utility function collection (debounce, throttle, memoize)
- Function composition utilities
- Currying and partial application helpers
- Higher-order function implementations
- Performance optimization techniques
