# Level 15: React Performance Optimization

**Goal**: Master React performance optimization techniques and strategies to build lightning-fast applications that provide exceptional user experiences.

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Identify performance bottlenecks using profiling tools and metrics
- Implement optimization patterns including memoization, lazy loading, and code splitting
- Master React optimization with useMemo, useCallback, React.memo, and Suspense
- Optimize bundle size through tree shaking, code splitting, and bundle analysis
- Monitor performance with real-time monitoring and Core Web Vitals
- Build fast applications using performance-first development practices

## Prerequisites
- Level 14: Testing & Quality Assurance
- Strong understanding of React hooks including useState, useEffect, useMemo, useCallback
- Basic knowledge of web performance metrics and Core Web Vitals
- Experience with browser developer tools and profiling

## Modules

### 1. Performance Fundamentals
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) and performance metrics
- Performance budgets and setting performance goals
- Profiling tools including React DevTools, Chrome DevTools, and Lighthouse
- Performance measurement and understanding metrics

### 2. React Optimization Techniques
- React.memo for preventing unnecessary re-renders
- useMemo hook for memoizing expensive calculations
- useCallback hook for memoizing event handlers
- useRef hook for avoiding unnecessary re-renders
- Suspense for code splitting and lazy loading

### 3. Bundle Optimization
- Code splitting with dynamic imports and route-based splitting
- Tree shaking for removing unused code
- Bundle analysis with Webpack Bundle Analyzer and tools
- Chunk optimization and bundle chunk strategies
- Preloading with resource hints and preloading strategies

### 4. Rendering Optimization
- Virtual DOM understanding and React's rendering process
- Reconciliation and optimizing component updates
- Key props and proper key usage for lists
- Component structure and optimizing component hierarchy
- State management and efficient state updates

### 5. Advanced Performance
- Web Workers for offloading heavy computations
- Service Workers for caching and offline functionality
- Image optimization with lazy loading and responsive images
- Network optimization with request optimization and caching
- Performance monitoring with real-time performance tracking
