# Level 10: React Fundamentals & Framework Comparison

**Goal**: Master React fundamentals, modern patterns, and compare with other popular frontend frameworks to make informed technology decisions.

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Master React fundamentals including components, hooks, and state management
- Understand modern React patterns and best practices
- Compare React with Vue, Angular, and Svelte
- Implement advanced React features and performance optimization
- Build scalable React applications with proper architecture

## Prerequisites
- Level 9: Build Systems & Developer Experience
- Strong understanding of JavaScript ES6+ features
- Experience with HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation
- Basic knowledge of component-based architecture

## Modules

### 1. React Fundamentals
- JSX syntax and React elements
- Components and props
- State and lifecycle methods
- Event handling and forms
- Lists and keys
- Conditional rendering

### 2. Modern React Patterns
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer)
- Custom hooks and composition
- Context API and state management
- Error boundaries and error handling
- Higher-order components and render props
- Compound components and children patterns

### 3. Advanced React Features
- Performance optimization (memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Server-side rendering (SSR) and Next.js
- React Router and navigation
- Testing React applications
- React DevTools and debugging

### 4. Framework Comparison
