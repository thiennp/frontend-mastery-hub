### Core Concepts

#### React Fundamentals
- **React Philosophy**: Declarative, component-based, learn once write anywhere
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient DOM updates and reconciliation
- **JSX**: JavaScript XML syntax and transformation
- **Component Model**: Reusable, composable UI components
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Predictable state management
- **React Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of libraries and tools

#### Components, Props, and State
- **Functional Components**: Modern React component pattern
- **Props**: Passing data between components
- **State**: Component internal state management
- **Component Composition**: Building complex UIs from simple components
- **Component Lifecycle**: Mounting, updating, and unmounting
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling in React

#### React Hooks & Modern Patterns
- **useState**: Managing component state
- **useEffect**: Side effects and lifecycle management
- **useContext**: Sharing data across component trees
- **useReducer**: Complex state logic management
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable stateful logic
- **Hook Rules**: Rules of hooks and best practices

#### Framework Comparison
- **React**: Component-based, virtual DOM, large ecosystem
- **Vue**: Progressive framework, template syntax, composition API
- **Svelte**: Compile-time framework, no virtual DOM, reactive
- **Angular**: Full-featured framework, TypeScript-first, dependency injection
- **Performance**: Bundle size, runtime performance, development experience
- **Ecosystem**: Libraries, tools, community, and learning resources

#### React Best Practices
- **Component Design**: Single responsibility, composition over inheritance
- **Performance Optimization**: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
- **State Management**: Local state, context, external state libraries
- **Testing**: Component testing, integration testing, testing utilities
- **Code Organization**: File structure, naming conventions, patterns
- **Accessibility**: ARIA support, keyboard navigation, screen readers

### Mini-Project: Multi-Framework Application

Build a comprehensive application in React and create equivalent implementations in other frameworks:

**Application Features**:
- **User Management**: Authentication, user profiles, permissions
- **Data Management**: CRUD operations, real-time updates, offline support
- **UI Components**: Reusable component library with variants
- **State Management**: Complex state with proper architecture
- **Routing**: Multi-page navigation and deep linking
- **Performance**: Optimization and performance monitoring

**Framework Implementations**:
- **React**: Primary implementation with modern patterns
- **Vue**: Equivalent Vue 3 implementation with Composition API
- **Svelte**: SvelteKit implementation with modern Svelte patterns
- **Angular**: Angular implementation with modern Angular patterns

**Technical Requirements**:
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support across all implementations
- **State Management**: Appropriate state management for each framework
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing for all implementations
- **Performance**: Performance comparison and optimization
- **Documentation**: Framework-specific implementation guides
- **Deployment**: Production deployment for all versions

**Comparison Analysis**:
- **Development Experience**: Setup, development speed, debugging
- **Performance**: Bundle size, runtime performance, memory usage
- **Ecosystem**: Available libraries, tools, and community support
- **Learning Curve**: Complexity and time to productivity
- **Use Cases**: When to choose each framework
