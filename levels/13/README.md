# Level 13: Forms & Data Integrity

**Goal**: Master form handling, validation, and data integrity in React applications to build robust, user-friendly forms with proper validation and security.

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Build complex forms with multi-step navigation and dynamic fields
- Implement comprehensive validation with client-side and server-side patterns
- Handle form state efficiently with controlled components and form libraries
- Ensure data integrity through input sanitization and type checking
- Optimize user experience with real-time validation and accessibility
- Test forms comprehensively with proper testing strategies

## Prerequisites
- Level 12: Advanced React Patterns
- Strong understanding of React hooks and component patterns
- Experience with HTML forms, input types, and form events
- Knowledge of data validation principles and security concepts

## Modules

### 1. Controlled Components
- Form state management with React hooks
- Input handling for text, select, checkbox, and radio inputs
- File uploads and handling
- Form events and state optimization
- Performance considerations for form updates

### 2. Form Validation
- Client-side validation patterns and real-time validation
- Validation libraries (Yup, Joi, Zod) and custom validators
- Error handling and display strategies
- Async validation and server-side integration
- Validation performance and user experience

### 3. Form Libraries & Tools
- React Hook Form for performance-optimized forms
- Formik for comprehensive form management
- React Final Form for subscription-based forms
- Form library comparison and selection
- Custom form hooks and utilities

### 4. Advanced Form Patterns
- Multi-step forms with wizard navigation
- Dynamic forms with add/remove functionality
- Conditional logic and field dependencies
- Form persistence and data recovery
- Form reset and state management

### 5. Data Integrity & Security
- Input sanitization and XSS prevention
- TypeScript integration and type safety
- Data normalization and formatting
- Server integration and API communication
- Accessibility and inclusive design

## Mini-Project: Advanced Form Management System
