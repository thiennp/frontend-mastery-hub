# Level 17: React Context & Providers

**Goal**: Master React Context API and provider patterns for global state management, building scalable context systems with optimized performance and reusable provider components.

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Master Context API with creation, consumption, and optimization techniques
- Build provider patterns with complex hierarchies and composition
- Optimize context performance to prevent unnecessary re-renders and updates
- Create custom providers with reusable context providers and hooks
- Handle context state with advanced state management patterns
- Design context architecture for scalable context systems

## Prerequisites
- Level 16: React Router & Navigation
- Strong understanding of React hooks including useState, useEffect, useContext, and custom hooks
- Experience with state management patterns and application state concepts
- Knowledge of component composition including props, children, and component patterns

## Modules

### 1. Context API Fundamentals
- Context creation with createContext and Provider components
- Context consumption using useContext hook and Consumer components
- Context value management for providing and updating context values
- Context scope understanding with context boundaries and scope
- Context patterns for basic context usage patterns

### 2. Provider Patterns
- Provider composition with multiple providers and nesting
- Provider hooks for custom hooks in context consumption
- Provider state management within providers
- Provider optimization with memoizing context values
- Provider testing for context providers and consumers

### 3. Advanced Context Patterns
- Context reducers with useReducer for complex state management
- Context actions for dispatching and state updates
- Context middleware for intercepting and transforming context updates
- Context persistence for persisting context state to localStorage
- Context validation with type checking and runtime validation

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Context splitting to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Value memoization with useMemo for context values
- Selective consumption for consuming only needed context values
- Context optimization with best practices for context performance
- Profiling context for identifying context performance issues

### 5. Context Architecture
- Context design for scalable context systems
- Context composition with multiple contexts
- Context testing for complex context interactions
- Context migration from other state management solutions
- Context best practices with industry best practices and patterns

## Mini-Project: Advanced Context Management System
Build a comprehensive context management system showcasing all advanced Context API patterns and provider architectures.

**Project Features**:
- Theme system with multiple themes, dark/light mode, and persistence
- User authentication context with profile management and permissions
- Shopping cart context with state management and persistence
- Notification system with context-based messaging
- Settings context with user preferences and configuration
- Performance optimization with context splitting and memoization
