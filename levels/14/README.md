# Level 14: Testing & Quality Assurance

**Goal**: Master comprehensive testing strategies and quality assurance practices for React applications to build reliable, maintainable, and high-quality software.

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Master testing fundamentals with unit, integration, and end-to-end testing strategies
- Use testing libraries effectively (Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, Playwright)
- Implement test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD) methodologies
- Build comprehensive test suites with proper organization and coverage
- Apply quality metrics including code coverage, performance testing, and monitoring
- Automate testing with CI/CD integration and continuous testing practices

## Prerequisites
- Level 13: Forms & Data Integrity
- Strong understanding of React components and their behavior
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript testing concepts and principles
- Experience with async programming, promises, and error handling

## Modules

### 1. Testing Fundamentals
- Testing pyramid with unit, integration, and E2E testing strategies
- Testing principles including AAA pattern, isolation, and independence
- Test types: unit, integration, snapshot, and visual regression testing
- Testing strategies and what to test vs what not to test
- Test organization with proper file structure and naming conventions

### 2. Unit Testing with Jest
- Jest configuration, setup, and configuration options
- Test structure with describe, it, beforeEach, and afterEach
- Assertions using expect, matchers, and custom matchers
- Mocking functions, modules, and timers effectively
- Async testing with promises, async/await, and callbacks

### 3. React Testing Library
- Component testing with rendering and user interactions
- Query methods: getBy, findBy, queryBy, and getAllBy
- User events with fireEvent and user-event library
- Custom render functions and providers
- Accessibility testing and screen reader compatibility

### 4. Integration Testing
- API testing with mocking API calls and responses
- State management testing for Redux, Context, and custom hooks
- Router testing for navigation and route changes
- Form testing for interactions and validation
- Error boundary testing for error handling and recovery

### 5. End-to-End Testing
- Cypress for E2E testing and test automation
- Playwright for cross-browser E2E testing
- Test scenarios for user journeys and critical paths
- Visual testing with screenshots and visual regression
- Performance testing with load testing and metrics

## Mini-Project: Comprehensive Testing Framework
Build a comprehensive testing framework showcasing all testing strategies and quality assurance practices.

**Project Features**:
- Unit testing with Jest for functions, utilities, and components
- Integration testing with React Testing Library for component interactions
- End-to-end testing with Cypress for user journeys and critical paths
- Performance testing and quality metrics with coverage reporting
- Custom testing utilities, mocks, and test data generators
- CI/CD integration with automated testing and quality gates
