- **Version Management**: Semantic versioning and changelogs
- **Migration Strategy**: Updating existing applications
- **Success Metrics**: Measuring adoption and impact

### Mini-Project: Comprehensive Design System

Build a complete design system that demonstrates enterprise-level design system development:

**System Components**:
- **Foundation**: Design tokens, typography, color, spacing, motion
- **Components**: Buttons, forms, navigation, data display, feedback
- **Patterns**: Layout patterns, interaction patterns, content patterns
- **Templates**: Page layouts and common screen patterns
- **Guidelines**: Usage guidelines, accessibility, and best practices

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Component Library**: React/Vue components with TypeScript
- **Design Tokens**: CSS custom properties and design token files
- **Documentation**: Storybook with comprehensive examples
- **Testing**: Unit tests, visual regression tests, accessibility tests
- **Build System**: Automated builds and package publishing
- **Version Control**: Semantic versioning and changelog management

**Advanced Features**:
- **Theme System**: Multiple themes and dynamic switching
- **Internationalization**: RTL support and cultural adaptations
- **Performance**: Bundle optimization and tree shaking
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance and inclusive design
- **Analytics**: Usage tracking and performance monitoring
- **Integration**: Design tool integration (Figma, Sketch)
