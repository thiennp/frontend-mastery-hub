- **State Architecture**: Organizing state logically and efficiently
- **State Updates**: Immutable updates and proper state mutation
- **State Synchronization**: Keeping state in sync across components

#### React Context & State Sharing
- **Context API**: Sharing data across component trees
- **Context Providers**: Providing state to child components
- **Context Consumers**: Consuming shared state
- **Context Optimization**: Preventing unnecessary re-renders
- **Context Composition**: Combining multiple contexts
- **Context Best Practices**: When and how to use context

#### External State Management Libraries
- **Redux Toolkit**: Modern Redux with simplified patterns
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management
- **Jotai**: Atomic state management
- **Recoil**: Facebook's experimental state management
- **XState**: State machine-based state management
- **Library Selection**: Choosing the right tool for the job

#### Side Effects & useEffect
- **useEffect Hook**: Managing side effects in functional components
- **Dependency Arrays**: Proper dependency management
- **Cleanup Functions**: Preventing memory leaks and side effects
- **Effect Timing**: When effects run and how to control them
- **Multiple Effects**: Organizing multiple side effects
- **Effect Optimization**: Preventing unnecessary effect runs

#### Anti-Pattern Prevention
- **State Mutation**: Avoiding direct state mutation
- **Effect Dependencies**: Proper dependency array management
- **State Batching**: Understanding React's state batching
- **Prop Drilling**: Alternatives to deep prop passing
- **Unnecessary Re-renders**: Preventing performance issues
- **Memory Leaks**: Proper cleanup and effect management

### Mini-Project: Complex State Management Application
