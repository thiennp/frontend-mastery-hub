# Level 2 â€” JavaScript Control Flow & Data Modeling

**Goal**: Master JavaScript control flow, data structures, and object-oriented programming patterns.

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Understand JavaScript control flow mechanisms (if/else, loops, switch)
- Master data structures: arrays, objects, maps, sets
- Implement object-oriented programming patterns
- Use modern JavaScript features for data manipulation
- Apply functional programming concepts

**Modules**:
- Control Flow & Conditional Logic
- Data Structures & Collections
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Functional Programming Basics
- Error Handling & Debugging

**Mini-Project**: Build a task management system with CRUD operations, filtering, and data persistence.

### Checklist
- [ ] Master if/else, switch statements, and ternary operators
- [ ] Implement loops (for, while, forEach, map, filter, reduce)
- [ ] Create and manipulate arrays, objects, maps, and sets
- [ ] Build classes with inheritance and encapsulation
- [ ] Apply functional programming concepts (pure functions, immutability)
- [ ] Implement error handling with try/catch blocks
- [ ] Complete the mini-project with local storage persistence

### Core Concepts

#### Control Flow
- **Conditional Statements**: if/else, switch, ternary operators
- **Loops**: for, while, do-while, for...of, for...in
- **Array Methods**: forEach, map, filter, reduce, find, some, every
- **Break & Continue**: Loop control and optimization

#### Data Structures
- **Arrays**: Creation, manipulation, and advanced methods
- **Objects**: Properties, methods, destructuring, spread operator
- **Maps & Sets**: Modern collection types for specific use cases
- **WeakMap & WeakSet**: Memory-efficient collections

#### Object-Oriented Programming
- **Classes**: Constructor, methods, static members
- **Inheritance**: extends, super, method overriding
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields, getters/setters
- **Polymorphism**: Interface-like patterns in JavaScript

#### Functional Programming
- **Pure Functions**: Side-effect free, predictable output
- **Immutability**: Object.freeze, spread operator, Object.assign
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take/return functions
- **Composition**: Function chaining and composition patterns

### Mini-Project: Task Management System

Build a comprehensive task management application that demonstrates all Level 2 concepts:

**Features**:
- Add, edit, delete, and complete tasks
- Filter tasks by status, priority, and category
- Sort tasks by due date, priority, or creation date
- Local storage persistence
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Task statistics and progress tracking

**Technical Requirements**:
- Use classes for Task and TaskManager
- Implement CRUD operations with proper error handling
- Use array methods for filtering, sorting, and searching
- Apply functional programming principles
- Include input validation and user feedback

### Assessment

Complete these challenges to earn your Level 2 badge:

1. **Control Flow Challenge**: Implement a complex decision tree with nested conditions
2. **Data Structure Challenge**: Build a custom data structure (e.g., priority queue)
3. **OOP Challenge**: Create an inheritance hierarchy for different task types
4. **Functional Challenge**: Refactor imperative code to functional style
5. **Integration Challenge**: Complete the mini-project with all features

### Resources

- **MDN**: JavaScript Control Flow and Error Handling
- **Eloquent JavaScript**: Chapter 2-4 (Program Structure, Functions, Data Structures)
- **You Don't Know JS**: Scope & Closures, this & Object Prototypes
- **Functional Programming in JavaScript**: Pure functions and immutability

### Next Level Preview

In Level 3, you'll dive deeper into functions, scope management, closures, and advanced JavaScript patterns that build upon the foundation established here.
