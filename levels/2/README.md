# Level 2: Control Flow & Data Structures

**Goal**: Master JavaScript control flow statements and data structures to write logical, efficient programs that can handle complex data manipulation and decision-making.

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Understand conditional statements and logical operators
- Master loops and iteration patterns
- Learn essential data structures (arrays, objects, sets, maps)
- Implement algorithms for data manipulation and searching
- Build interactive programs with complex logic

## Prerequisites
- Level 1: Web Fundamentals
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Familiarity with variables and data types

## Modules

### 1. Conditional Statements & Logic
- if/else statements and ternary operators
- switch statements and case handling
- Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Truthy and falsy values
- Comparison operators and type coercion
- Nested conditions and complex logic

### 2. Loops & Iteration
- for loops and while loops
- do-while loops and loop control
- for...in and for...of loops
- Array iteration methods (forEach, map, filter)
- Loop optimization and performance
- Breaking and continuing loops

### 3. Arrays & Array Methods
- Array creation and manipulation
- Array methods (push, pop, shift, unshift, splice)
- Array iteration and transformation
- Array searching and filtering
- Array sorting and reversing
- Multidimensional arrays

### 4. Objects & Object Manipulation
- Object creation and property access
- Object methods and this keyword
- Object iteration and enumeration
- Object destructuring and spread operator
- Object comparison and cloning
- Prototype and inheritance basics

### 5. Advanced Data Structures
- Sets and their unique properties
- Maps and key-value pairs
- WeakMap and WeakSet
- Data structure selection criteria
- Performance considerations
- Real-world data structure usage
