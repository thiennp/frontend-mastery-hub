# Level 4: Asynchronous JavaScript

**Goal**: Master asynchronous JavaScript programming including callbacks, promises, and async/await to handle time-consuming operations and create responsive web applications.

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Understand the JavaScript event loop and asynchronous execution
- Master callback functions and callback patterns
- Learn Promise creation, chaining, and error handling
- Implement async/await for cleaner asynchronous code
- Build responsive applications that handle async operations

## Prerequisites
- Level 3: Functions & Scope
- Understanding of JavaScript functions and scope
- Basic knowledge of web APIs and browser environment

## Modules

### 1. Asynchronous Programming Fundamentals
- Synchronous vs asynchronous execution
- JavaScript event loop and call stack
- Web APIs and browser environment
- Callback functions and callback patterns
- Common async operations (timers, network requests)
- Error handling in async code

### 2. Promises & Promise Patterns
- Promise creation and states
- Promise chaining and composition
- Promise.all() and Promise.race()
- Error handling with catch()
- Converting callbacks to promises
- Promise best practices and anti-patterns

### 3. Async/Await & Modern Patterns
- async/await syntax and usage
- Error handling with try/catch
- Sequential vs parallel execution
- Async function composition
- Top-level await and module loading
- Performance considerations

### 4. Fetch API & HTTP Requests
- Making HTTP requests with fetch()
- Request and Response objects
- Error handling and status codes
- Request configuration and headers
- File uploads and form data
- CORS and security considerations

### 5. Real-World Async Patterns
- Loading states and user feedback
- Debouncing and throttling
- Retry logic and exponential backoff
- Timeout handling and cancellation
- Progress tracking and monitoring
- Async data management

## Mini-Project: Async Data Dashboard
Build a comprehensive dashboard that fetches and displays data from multiple APIs with proper loading states and error handling.

**Project Features**:
- Multiple API integrations with fetch()
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Data caching and optimization
- Real-time updates and polling
- Responsive user interface
