# Commit After Level Completion Rule

## Always Commit and Push After Finishing One Level

### **MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**
When completing any level implementation, you MUST:

1. **Commit Changes Immediately**
   - Stage all new files and modifications
   - Create a descriptive commit message
   - Include level number and completion status

2. **Push to Remote Repository**
   - Push changes to the remote branch
   - Ensure all work is safely backed up
   - Verify push was successful

### **Commit Message Format:**
```
feat: Complete Level X - [Level Name]

- Implemented 5 interactive exercises
- Added level-specific styling and functionality
- Updated main hub navigation and progress tracking
- Updated PROGRESS_TRACKING.md with completion status

Progress: X/200 levels complete (X%)
```

### **Implementation Steps:**
1. Complete all level files (HTML, CSS, JS)
2. Update main hub (index.html, script.js)
3. Update PROGRESS_TRACKING.md
4. **IMMEDIATELY COMMIT AND PUSH**
5. Verify push success before proceeding

### **Why This Rule Exists:**
- **Data Safety:** Prevents loss of completed work
- **Version Control:** Maintains clean commit history
- **Collaboration:** Keeps remote repository up-to-date
- **Progress Tracking:** Each level completion is a milestone
- **Rollback Safety:** Easy to revert if issues arise

### **Commands to Use:**
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Complete Level X - [Level Name]"

# Push to remote
git push origin gh-pages
```

### **Verification:**
- Check git status shows "working tree clean"
- Verify push output shows "successful"
- Confirm remote repository has latest changes

**This rule is MANDATORY and must be followed after EVERY level completion.**
