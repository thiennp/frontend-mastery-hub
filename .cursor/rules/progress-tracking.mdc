# Progress Tracking Rule

## Always Continue from PROGRESS_TRACKING.md
- Always read and reference the PROGRESS_TRACKING.md file at the start of any task
- Use the current progress state to understand what has been completed and what needs to be done next
- Build upon existing work rather than starting from scratch

## Always Update PROGRESS_TRACKING.md
- Update PROGRESS_TRACKING.md immediately after completing any task or milestone
- Document what was accomplished, including:
  - Completed tasks
  - New features or improvements
  - Bug fixes
  - Any changes to the project structure
- Keep the progress tracking accurate and up-to-date for future reference

## Always Commit and Push After Level Completion
- **MANDATORY:** Commit and push changes immediately after completing any level
- Stage all files: `git add .`
- Commit with descriptive message: `git commit -m "feat: Complete Level X - [Level Name]"`
- Push to remote: `git push origin gh-pages`
- Verify push success before proceeding to next level

## Implementation
- Before starting work: Read PROGRESS_TRACKING.md to understand current state
- During work: Reference the progress file to stay aligned with project goals
- After completing work: Update PROGRESS_TRACKING.md with new accomplishments
- **IMMEDIATELY AFTER:** Commit and push all changes to preserve work
