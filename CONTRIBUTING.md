# Contributing Guide

Thank you for helping improve Frontend Mastery Hub! This document outlines the process for adding code or curriculum content to the repository.

## Branching Strategy
- Develop on dedicated branches created from `main`.
- Use descriptive branch names such as `feat/topic-name` or `fix/bug-description`.
- Avoid committing directly to `main`; all work should land via pull requests.

## Commit Style
- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages (e.g., `feat: add react router lesson`).
- Keep messages concise and focused on a single change.
- Run relevant checks before committing to ensure the repository remains stable.

## Review Process
- Open a pull request once your branch is ready and ensure all checks pass.
- At least one reviewer must approve before merging.
- Address feedback promptly and keep discussions in the pull request thread.

## Curriculum Alignment
- All educational content must align with the existing dual-track curriculum.
- Reference the **Curriculum Structure** in the `README.md` when proposing new modules, noting the track (Core or Extended), phase, and level where the content fits.
- Ensure submissions complement existing material and maintain the roadmap outlined in `Roadmap.md`.

By following these guidelines, contributors can help keep the project organized and aligned with its learning goals. Happy contributing!
