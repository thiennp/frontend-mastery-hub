# Level 2 Mini-Project: Task Management System

## Overview

Build a comprehensive task management application that demonstrates all Level 2 concepts including control flow, data structures, object-oriented programming, functional programming, and error handling.

## Features

- Add, edit, delete, and complete tasks
- Filter tasks by status, priority, and category
- Sort tasks by due date, priority, or creation date
- Local storage persistence
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Task statistics and progress tracking

## Technical Requirements

- Use classes for Task and TaskManager
- Implement CRUD operations with proper error handling
- Use array methods for filtering, sorting, and searching
- Apply functional programming principles
- Include input validation and user feedback

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Start adding tasks using the form
3. Use filters and sorting to organize tasks
4. Check the browser console for any errors

## Learning Objectives

- Practice object-oriented programming with classes
- Implement complex control flow with conditionals and loops
- Use arrays and objects for data management
- Apply functional programming concepts
- Handle errors gracefully
- Build a complete application from scratch
