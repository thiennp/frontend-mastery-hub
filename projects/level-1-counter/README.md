# Level 1 Counter

A minimal JavaScript counter app.

## Running the project

Open [`index.html`](./index.html) directly in your browser or serve the folder with a static file server such as [`serve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve):

```bash
npx serve .
```

## Extending the project

Here are a few ideas for building on top of this app:

- Style the page with your own CSS.
- Add decrement and reset buttons.
- Persist the count in `localStorage`.
- Display a message when certain counts are reached.
